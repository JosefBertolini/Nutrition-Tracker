# Nutrition-Tracker
A Completed Version of the Nutrition Tracker. Built to run on windows using WPF. This can track daily macro nutrients and keep track of the last seven days to see if you're on a streak , it also tracks weight loss/gain/maintenance over time. You can have multiple users as well as the ability to change your profile later (expect the username, that's permanent). Please Download the Release Verison and tell me what you think!

The source itself is still a little messy, but this is what I got done before school started.
